Mood Wave is a playlist generating application that creates customized New Wave playlists based on your mood.

## Technologies

  - Node.js
- HTML/CSS, Sass/SCSS

## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to access the playlist generator page from the Mood Wave homepage
- As a user, I should be able to select a mood based on a predetermined list of options
- As a user, I should receive a list of songs that are associated with my chosen mood
- As a user, I should be able to access each song's LastFM page from the playlist show page

## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans
- I would like to find an API that allows me to play each of the songs on my playlist directly on the page without having to leave to go to the LastFM detail page
- I would like to add more moods to my seed data
